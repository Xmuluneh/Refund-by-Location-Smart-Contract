# Project Overview

GeoLogix Solutions is revolutionizing the logistics and delivery industry with its cutting-edge GPS and blockchain technology. To ensures timely deliveries within designated zones through an Ethereum-based decentralized application (dApp), automatically rewarding drivers for geographical compliance. 

## Key Features

- **Efficiency:** GeoLogix sets a new benchmark in efficiency, reliability, and transparency, leading the way in tech-driven logistics solutions.
  
- **Automatic Payments:** Our platform utilizes a location-based smart contract to facilitate automatic payments for drivers who remain within specified geographic zones for set durations. 

- **Smart Contract Integration:** This system involves drivers' smartphones transmitting GPS data to an Ethereum smart contract at predetermined intervals. When a driver meets the conditions outlined in the contract, a cryptocurrency transaction is processed as payment.

- **Driver Rating System:** Should GPS tracking reveal a driver straying from the assigned area, the smart contract updates to reflect non-compliance, impacting the driver's internal rating. This rating system evaluates drivers, penalizing deviations with lower scores, while rewarding adherence with higher ratings.

- **ERC20 Token Integration:** An ERC20 token is integrated into the smart contract, serving as the basis for a rewards system. Drivers who consistently meet compliance criteria receive these tokens as additional incentives, enhancing their performance.

## Project Goal

The goal of the project is to develop and deploy an Ethereum-based decentralized application (dApp) that includes a thoroughly tested smart contract on a testnet, accompanied by a user interface for real-time status monitoring and management by GeoLogix Solutions.
